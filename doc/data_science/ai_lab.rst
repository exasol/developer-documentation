Exasol's AI-Lab
================

Exasol has significant capabilities for implementing data science workflows - from classic machine learning to Gen AI and language model solutions.


What is AI-Lab?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

AI-Lab is a collection of interactive computational notebooks created by Exasol to showcase and demonstrate the capabilities of Exasol and its infrastructure in the context of Machine Learning and AI.

Reasons why you should try the Exasol's AI-Lab?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Learn how Exasol uses it's infrastructure for AI and Machine Learning Algorithims? 
* Learn how `User Defined Functions (UDFs) <https://docs.exasol.com/db/latest/database_concepts/udf_scripts.htm>`_ work in Exasol? 
* Experience the MPP Architecture (how the exasol database allows running a predictive model on multiple nodes in parallel).
* Learn how to store models in `BucketFS <https://docs.exasol.com/db/latest/database_concepts/bucketfs/bucketfs.htm>`_. (Exasol proprietary replicated file system)?
