Parallel Processing for AI/ML
===============================

Parallel Processing in Exasol means that computations are distributed across multiple nodes in the database cluster, allowing large datasets to be processed simultaneously rather than sequentially.

In AI/ML workflows, MPP helps by:

Speeding up data preparation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Large datasets can be filtered, aggregated, and transformed quickly.

Enabling scalable model training
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Training data can be processed in parallel, reducing preprocessing time.

Accelerating inference
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Predictions over millions of rows can be computed efficiently using UDFs across nodes.

Reducing data movement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Data stays in the database, avoiding costly extraction to external ML environments.




==========================

Overall, Exasol's AI Architecture ensures that AI/ML workflows are fast, scalable, and efficient, even with very large datasets.
