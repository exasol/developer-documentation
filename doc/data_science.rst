Data Science with Exasol
=========================

Exasol has significant capabilities for implementing data science workflows - from classic machine learning to Gen AI and language model solutions.

Exasol's AI-Lab
-----------------
AI-LAB is a collection of interactive computational notebooks created by Exasol to showcase and demonstrate the capabilities of Exasol and it's infrastructure in context of Machine Learning and AI. 

Should you try the Exasol's AI-Lab?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Are you interested in AI or Machine Learning? Do you have knowledge about AI and Machine learning algorithims but, you don't want to go through the effort of implementing everything yourself?
Do you want to know how Exasol uses it's infrastructure for machine learning algorithims? How UDF's work in Exasol? How to run multiple models in parallel? How to store models in BucketFS (Exasol proprietary replicated file system)?
Then AI-Lab is for you.
