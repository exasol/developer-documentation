Intro to UDFs
-------------

UDF scripts allow you to program your own analysis, processing, and generation functions, and to execute these functions in parallel inside an Exasol cluster. 
By using UDF scripts, you can solve problems that are not possible to solve with SQL statements.

Exasol supports the programming languages Java, Lua, R, and Python in UDF scripts. These languages provide different functionalities (for example, statistical functions in R) and different libraries.

UDFs are the key to unlocking much of Exasol's AI, ML and Data Science potential, as well as customizing Exasol to suit your unique use cases.
UDFs are executed by Exasol's massively parallel query engine and scale across available hardware in the same way SQL queries do - this gives them significant performance potential.
